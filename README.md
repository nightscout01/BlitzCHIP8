# BlitzCHIP8
A CHIP8 Emulator Written in Blitz3D

This was more of a silly proof of concept project than anything useful. Blitz doesn't even have a simple way to print out values as hexadecimal, so the opcode printouts are in base 10. There is no graphical output currently and I doubt I'll ever get around to adding it either.
